# Authentication & Route Protection Guide

## 🔐 **Implemented Features**

### **1. Logout Functionality**
- ✅ **Proper Logout**: Clears all authentication data from Redux and localStorage
- ✅ **Auto Navigation**: After logout, user is redirected to signup/register page
- ✅ **Complete Cleanup**: Clears user data, token, elections, and candidates from state

### **2. Route Protection**
- ✅ **Protected Routes**: Results, Elections, Election Details, Candidates, and Congrates pages
- ✅ **Auto Redirect**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
- ✅ **Admin Protection**: AdminRoute component for admin-only features

### **3. Dynamic Navigation**
- ✅ **Conditional Menu**: Navbar shows different menu items for authenticated vs unauthenticated users
- ✅ **User Info Display**: Shows "Welcome, Admin" or "Welcome, Voter" in navbar
- ✅ **Smart Routing**: Login redirects based on user role

## 📋 **Protected Routes**

### **Authentication Required:**
- `/results` - Election results page (protected)
- `/elections` - Elections listing page (protected)
- `/elections/:id` - Election details page (protected)  
- `/elections/:id/candidates` - Candidates and voting page (protected)
- `/congrates` - Vote confirmation page (protected)

### **Public Routes:**
- `/` - Login page (public)
- `/register` - Registration page (public)
- `/logout` - Logout handler (accessible to authenticated users)

## 🔄 **Authentication Flow**

### **Login Process:**
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Frontend calls login API with Redux thunk
3. Backend validates and returns token + user data
4. Frontend stores token in localStorage and Redux
5. User is redirected to elections page
6. Navbar updates to show authenticated menu

### **Logout Process:**
1. User clicks logout (in navbar or navigates to `/logout`)
2. Redux state is cleared (user data, token, elections, candidates)
3. localStorage is cleared (token and currentUser)
4. User is redirected to register page
5. Navbar updates to show unauthenticated menu

### **Route Protection:**
1. User tries to access protected route
2. ProtectedRoute component checks for valid token
3. If authenticated: renders the requested component
4. If not authenticated: redirects to login page

## 🛠 **Components Created/Updated**

### **New Components:**
- `ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Wraps protected pages
- `AdminRoute.jsx` - For admin-only features  
- `LogoutButton.jsx` - Reusable logout button

### **Updated Components:**
- `Logout.jsx` - Now properly handles logout and redirect
- `Navbar.jsx` - Dynamic menu based on auth state
- `Result.jsx` - Now protected and uses API data
- `Login.jsx` - Smart redirect after login
- `main.jsx` - Route protection implementation

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Using ProtectedRoute:**
```jsx
// In routing
{
  path: 'results',
  element: <ProtectedRoute><Result/></ProtectedRoute>
}
```

### **Using LogoutButton:**
```jsx
// In any component
import LogoutButton from '../components/LogoutButton';

<LogoutButton className="btn danger">Sign Out</LogoutButton>
```

### **Checking Auth State:**
```jsx
// In any component
const { currentVoter } = useSelector(state => state.vote);

if (currentVoter.token) {
  // User is authenticated
  if (currentVoter.isAdmin) {
    // User is admin
  }
}
```

## 🚦 **Current Authentication States**

### **Unauthenticated User:**
- Can only access: `/` (login) and `/register`
- Navbar shows: Login, Register
- Trying to access protected routes → redirected to login

### **Authenticated Regular User:**
- Can access: All protected routes
- Navbar shows: Elections, Results, Logout + "Welcome, Voter"
- Can vote but cannot create elections/candidates

### **Authenticated Admin User:**
- Can access: All protected routes + admin features
- Navbar shows: Elections, Results, Logout + "Welcome, Admin"  
- Can create elections, add candidates, and vote

## 🧪 **Testing the Authentication**

### **Test Logout:**
1. Login as any user
2. Click "Logout" in navbar or navigate to `/logout`
3. Should redirect to `/register`
4. Navbar should show Login/Register options
5. Trying to access `/results` should redirect to login

### **Test Route Protection:**
1. Without logging in, try to access `/results`
2. Should automatically redirect to login page
3. Login and try `/results` again
4. Should now show the results page

### **Test Different User Types:**
1. Register with `iitadmin@gmail.com` (becomes admin)
2. Login and verify navbar shows "Welcome, Admin"
3. Register with any other email (becomes regular user)
4. Login and verify navbar shows "Welcome, Voter"

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Admin User Setup:**
- Email: `iitadmin@gmail.com` automatically becomes admin
- All other emails become regular voters

### **Route Redirects:**
- After login: Always redirects to `/elections`
- After logout: Always redirects to `/register`
- Unauthorized access: Redirects to `/` (login)

The authentication system is now complete and provides proper security for your voting application!
