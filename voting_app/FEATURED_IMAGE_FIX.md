# 🎯 Featured Image Upload - FIXED!

## ❌ **The Problem**
The featured image upload wasn't working because of incorrect `Content-Type` headers being set manually in the frontend code.

### Root Cause:
1. **blogService.js** was manually setting `'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'`
2. This prevented the browser from adding the required **boundary parameter**
3. The server couldn't parse the multipart data without the boundary

### Why This Matters:
- When uploading files, browsers need to set: `multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary...`
- Manual setting blocked this automatic boundary generation
- Backend couldn't parse the form data correctly

## ✅ **The Solution**

### Files Fixed:
1. **`src/services/blogService.js`** - Removed manual Content-Type headers
2. **`src/services/api.js`** - Added FormData detection in axios interceptor

### Changes Made:

#### 1. blogService.js
```javascript
// ❌ Before (BROKEN):
const response = await api.post('/blogs', formData, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data', // This blocks boundary!
  },
});

// ✅ After (FIXED):
const response = await api.post('/blogs', formData, {
  headers: {
    // Don't set Content-Type - let browser set it with boundary
  },
});
```

#### 2. api.js
```javascript
// Added FormData detection:
if (config.data instanceof FormData) {
  delete config.headers['Content-Type'];
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### What Should Work Now:
1. ✅ **Featured Image Upload** - Main blog creation with image
2. ✅ **Blog Content Images** - Multiple image uploads for blog content  
3. ✅ **Blog Updates** - Updating featured images
4. ✅ **All File Types** - JPG, PNG, WEBP under 2MB

### Test Steps:
1. Open the blog creation page
2. Select a featured image (< 2MB)
3. Fill in title and content
4. Click "Create Blog"
5. **Expected Result:** Blog created with featured image visible

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Backend Status: ✅ Working Perfect
- Cloudinary configured and connected
- Local storage fallback working
- File upload middleware working
- Authentication working

### Frontend Status: ✅ Now Fixed
- FormData creation: ✅ Correct
- File handling: ✅ Correct  
- Headers: ✅ Fixed - No manual Content-Type
- Axios configuration: ✅ Enhanced with FormData detection

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
1. **Test the fix** - Try creating a blog with featured image
2. **Verify images display** - Check if uploaded images show correctly
3. **Test content images** - Try uploading images within blog content
4. **Test updates** - Try updating blog with new featured image

## 💡 **Key Takeaway**
**Never manually set `'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'` when using FormData!**
Let the browser handle it automatically to include the boundary parameter.
